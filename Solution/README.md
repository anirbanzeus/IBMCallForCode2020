## Overview

### What's the problem?

The COVID19 crisis has taken a huge humanitarian toll in the informal employment sector. Acting almost like a bomb, it has shattered to pieces the patch employment framework that was the livelihood of many in the developing countries such as India. With no job at hand food and survivability itself comes into question. Even when governments ease restrictions these unorganised labourers are left at the mercy of timing and contacts to earn two square meals a day.

### How can technology help?

Mobile, web, and cloud services enable rapid deployment of applications that can empower cooperation in the community. It can help power a platform that can enable these individuals to "Uberize" their skillset and capabilities.

Creating a chatbot using Watson Assistant can help you address the issues that your users may face while trying to gather the necessary information. Embedding location/routing services (like [HERE](https://developer.here.com/products/routing)) can enhance such applications, giving optimum guidance so that they are outside of their isolation location for the minimum amount of time. Additionally one can leverage the IBM could computing capabilities to stitch together a set of Open-source API and expand the information net.
